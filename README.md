Project Summary:

The purpose of this project was to analyze a dataset of movie ratings to uncover insights about audience preferences, rating trends, and genre popularity. Through data cleaning, visualization, and analysis, we aimed to better understand how factors like release year, genre, and user votes influence movie ratings. By exploring patterns in the data, we gained valuable insights into which genres receive the highest ratings, how ratings fluctuate over time, and the correlation between user engagement and movie success. This analysis provided a clearer picture of audience behavior, enabling data-driven recommendations for improving user experience and engagement on movie platforms.
